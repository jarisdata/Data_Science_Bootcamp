-- PROJECT 1 (Magist): ANSWERING BUSINESS QUESTIONS WITH TABLEAU (see. project description for more details)


-- 1. How many orders are there in the dataset (i.e. orders table)?
SELECT *
FROM orders;

SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Total number of orders'
FROM orders;

-- 2. Are orders actually delivered (i.e. order_status)?
# With a delivery rate above 98,7% of active or delivered orders (i.e. approved, created, processing, invoiced, shipped), and 1.2% of orders cancelled or unavailable, delivery appears to be generally reliable. 

SELECT order_status, COUNT(order_status) as 'Total number' 
FROM orders
WHERE order_status IN ('delivered', 'shipped', 'invoiced', 'processing', 'created', 'approved')
GROUP BY order_status
ORDER BY COUNT(order_status) DESC;

WITH deliveries as (
SELECT COUNT(*) as delivered_orders
,(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders) as total_orders
FROM orders
WHERE order_status IN ('delivered', 'shipped', 'invoiced', 'processing', 'created', 'approved')
) 
SELECT ((100/total_orders)*delivered_orders) as 'Ratio'
FROM deliveries
;


--  3) Is Magist experiencing user growth? Number of orders grouped by year and month. 
-- 	With an average monthly order growth of 23% Magist experienced a strong year in 2017. 
-- In 2018, however, order growth was stagnant at 2% up until August and then broke down almost entirely in September and October

SELECT YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) as 'Year', COUNT(YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp)) as 'Number of Orders'
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp);

SELECT YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) as 'Year', MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp) as 'MONTH', COUNT(MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp)) as 'Number of Orders'
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp), MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp);


--  4)  How many products are there on the products table (excl. duplicates)? 
-- With 32951 distinct products, Magist has a very large range of goods

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(product_id)) as 'Distinct product IDs'
FROM products;


-- 5) Which are the categories with the most products? 
-- The top 20, reflecting approx. 83% of the entire product range, feature three relevant product categories: computer accessories (7th, 4.97%) and telephony (10th, 3,44%), and elecronics (18th, 1.57).
-- Caution: This says nothing about their share in actual orders 

SELECT pcnt.product_category_name_english AS 'Product category', COUNT(DISTINCT(p.product_id)) AS 'Number of products'
FROM products as p
JOIN product_category_name_translation as pcnt
	ON p.product_category_name = pcnt.product_category_name
GROUP BY pcnt.product_category_name_english
-- GROUP BY product_category_name
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT(product_id)) DESC;

-- 6) How many of those products were present in actual transactions? (Check products and orders_items table)

SELECT pcnt.product_category_name_english AS 'Product_Category'
	, COUNT(oi.order_id) AS 'Items_ordered'
    , ROUND((100/      
    (SELECT COUNT(*) from order_items) -- WHERE order_status IN ('delivered', 'shipped', 'invoiced', 'processing', 'created', 'approved'))
     )*COUNT(oi.order_id), 2) AS 'Percentage_Share'
 --   , (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items) as 'All_items_ordered' 
 --   , ((100/All_items_ordered)*Items_ordered) as 'Percentage_share'
FROM orders as o
JOIN order_items as oi
	on o.order_id = oi.order_id

	on p.product_id = oi.product_id

WHERE o.order_status IN ('delivered', 'shipped', 'invoiced', 'processing', 'created', 'approved')
GROUP BY pcnt.product_category_name_english
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- 7.) What’s the price for the most expensive and cheapest products? Basing range of prices and min and max
-- Price-category analysis of total orders: 
-- Calculating sales and average prices per product and price category yieled various interesting results.
-- Looking at the importance of highly priced tech gear (i.e. telephony, electronics, computers accessories)  
-- much seems to speak again cooperating with Magist. With 35% and 29% low and lower medium price goods under 50€ and 100€, make up 35% and 29% of total orders, respectively. 
-- As an example, sales in telephony goods are dominated by low cost (⦰27€) and lower medium cost (⦰74€) goods, ranking 2nd with 3.508 and 74th with 290 sales, respectively, out of a total of 328 price-product categories in Magist's overall orders.  
-- Telephony goods with an upper medium price (⦰309€), in contrast only rank 93th with 182 items sold. High priced telephony goods (⦰909€) rank even lower as 148th with only 75 items sold.
-- The pattern is the same for high priced computer accessories (⦰997€), which with 158 items sold rank 100th.
-- Electronics upper medium (⦰359€) price category ranks 161th with 59 items sold; eletronics with a high price (⦰1.095€) follow on rank 230 with a mere 19 sales.

-- Questions relating to sellers:
--  How many months of data included? 22 months
-- How many tech sellers (total and share of sellers)? Total amount earned by tech sellers?
-- There are 3095 total sellers, 483 of which are tech sellers (computer accessories = 287, electronics = 149, telephony = 149).
-- Average monthly income of tech sellers has varied between €75 in September 2016 and €1.924 in February 2018 in comparison to all sellers. Overall, it has been at €1.091. 
-- That contrasts with €1.044 for all sellers, where over the course of almost two years the minimu was €20 and the maximum €1.641.
